[b]Post Board Select[/b]

This add-on adds a select box to the post form in which you can select the board that you want to post. It gives ability to the user for posting to a board that they are not already in. It checks the needed permissions and after the post is made it redirects back to the board in which the post was made. It only appears while posting a new topic.
